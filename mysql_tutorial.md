## 1. Introduction to MySQL

### What is MySQL?

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use. It stores data in structured tables with predefined schemas.

### Why use MySQL?

- **Ease of Use**: MySQL's simple setup and configuration make it a popular choice.
- **Relational Structure**: Data is organized in tables with relationships.
- **Performance**: Efficient handling of large datasets and complex queries.
- **Community Support**: Active community and extensive documentation.

### Key Concepts

- **Database**: A container for tables and related data.
- **Table**: A structured collection of data stored in rows and columns.
- **Row**: A record in a table.
- **Column**: A field within a table.
- **Primary Key**: Unique identifier for each row in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: Links one table to another based on a column.

## 2. Getting Started

### Installing MySQL

1. Visit the MySQL download page: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/
2. Choose your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

### Running MySQL Server

1. After installation, start the MySQL server.
   - On Windows: Start MySQL from the Services panel.
   - On macOS/Linux: Open Terminal and run `sudo service mysql start`

### Basic MySQL Command Line

1. **Open MySQL Command Line**:

   - On Windows: Open Command Prompt and run `mysql -u root -p`
   - On macOS/Linux: Open Terminal and run `mysql -u root -p`

2. **Show Databases**: `SHOW DATABASES;`

3. **Switch Database**: `USE database_name;`

4. **Show Tables**: `SHOW TABLES;`

## 3. CRUD Operations in MySQL

### Create

To insert data into a table:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

### Read

To query data from a table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

### Update

To update data in a table:

```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```

### Delete

To delete data from a table:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

### Examples

- **Create**:

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com');
  ```

- **Read**:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users;
  SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE id = 1;
  ```

- **Update**:

  ```sql
  UPDATE users SET email = 'new_email@example.com' WHERE id = 1;
  ```

- **Delete**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
  ```

## 4. Views in MySQL

### What are Views?

Views are virtual tables created by a query. They allow you to simplify complex queries and provide a structured view of the data.

### Creating Views

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

### Modifying Views

```sql
ALTER VIEW view_name AS SELECT new_columns FROM new_conditions;
```

## 5. Stored Procedures in MySQL

### What are Stored Procedures?

Stored Procedures are precompiled SQL statements that can be executed multiple times. They improve code reusability and security.

### Creating Stored Procedures

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name (IN parameter_name datatype)
BEGIN
   -- SQL statements
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

### Calling Stored Procedures

```sql
CALL procedure_name(parameter_value);
```
